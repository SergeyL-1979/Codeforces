We are taking a random walk on the vertices of the boolean hypercube with vertices $$$\\{0,1\\}^n.$$$ (Each of the $$$n$$$ bits corresponds to one dimension of the cube), and toggling one bit corresponds to moving along an edge. This is clearly symmetric with respect to each of the $$$2^n$$$ vertices. By symmetry of the cube, the stationary probability is the same for each vertex and so each is equal to $$$\\frac{1}{2^n}.$$$</p><p>More generally the stationary distribution on an unweighted finite graph (neighbors picked uniformly at random) is $$$\\pi_v = \\frac{deg(v)}{2E}$$$ where $$$E$$$ is the number of edges.</p></div>",
